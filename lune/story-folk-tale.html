    <h1>How the Moon Was Created</h1>
    
        <div class="txt">
        
<p>A very long time ago, when the world was just created, the moon was not there and the sun shone all the time. There was no concept of night as the sun never set. It was bright and sunny and there was daylight all the time. People worked hard continuously and did not realize when to rest.</p>
<p>One fine day, the creator of the world visited the men in the fields while they were working.</p>
<p>He asked one of the men,"When did you last water this field?"</p>
<p>"Today," replied the sweating farmer.</p>
<p>"And when did you dig the hole?"</p>
<p>"Today," replied another man.</p>
<p>"When did you plant those trees in the garden?"</p>
<p>"Today,of course.  It is day all the time so everything was done today."</p>
<p>The creator then saw a woman with a small child and asked her, "When was your son born?"</p>
<p>"Today," replied the woman.</p>
<p>The creator then understood that the people of the world had no understanding of time; they would work all the time as they couldn't understand the division of day and night. He thought that he should do something about it. He then told the sun, "You must shine all day and set in the evening, and rise once again the next morning. People will then realise the difference between day and night. They will stop working when it becomes dark and will get some rest." The sun readily agreed.</p>
<p>When it became evening,the sun went down quietly. Suddenly, everything became dark. Everyone got scared with the abrupt darkness.They panicked and ran here and there, some stumbled upon each other and some hurt themselves by falling into ditches. People were not used to this and so they did not realise what to do about it.</p>
<p>Finally,the leaders and the elderly realised that nothing could be done in the darkness, so they told everyone,"Please lie down and take some rest, and you shall work again when it becomes bright." When the sun came up the next morning, everyone woke up and started working.Thus, from then on, night became the time for resting.</p>
<p>People started living more happily and comfortably,as they were well rested. But one problem still persisted. It became completely dark after sunset, so the people could not see anything at all.They would often bang against a tree, and hurt themselves by hitting against rocks and falling into ditches. They also broke things as they couldn't see where they were kept.</p>
<p>After some days the creator visited them once again and asked them,"Are you happy now?"</p>
<p>"Yes, we are. We sleep all night and wake up fresh to work the next morning," replied a man. "But there is still one problem - we cannot see anything in the dark. We tend to hurt each other and break a lot of things. Can we at least have the sun for some time?" asked the man.</p>
<p>The creator thought for some time, and replied, "No, you can't. But don't worry. I shall give you something else, something more soothing and less bright than the sun.You can see things and still sleep peacefully in its presence."</p>
<p>Then he created the moon. People were extremely happy, as they could see at night and did not hurt themselves any more. They slept peacefully in the light of the moon and woke up the next day when the sun shone brightly.</p>
<p>Thus, the moon was created.</p>
