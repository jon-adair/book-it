        <div class="txt"><p>Neil Armstong also known as the first man on the moon. On August 5, 1930 Neil was born in Wapakoneta, Ohio. At age 14 he started taking flying lessons, and at age 16 on his birthday he was issued his pilot's license. He had built a small air tunnel in his basement at home (a tunnel used to study the effect of air flow) he also studied his model planes. At a young age he wanted to work in aeronautics, or construction, design, and aircraft control. He also became interested in outer space, then in July 1969 he stated the famous words "one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind".</p>
            
            <p>Before becoming an astronaut, Armstrong was an officer in the U.S. Navy and served in the Korean War. After the war, he earned his bachelor's degree at Purdue University and served as a test pilot at the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) High-Speed Flight Station, where he logged over 900 flights. He later completed graduate studies at the University of Southern California.</p>
            
            <p>He made his first space flight as command pilot of Gemini 8 in March 1966, becoming NASA's first civilian astronaut to fly in space. He performed the first docking of two spacecraft, with pilot David Scott.[1] This mission was aborted after Armstrong used some of his reentry control fuel to prevent a dangerous spin caused by a stuck thruster, in the first in-flight space emergency.</p>
            
            <p>Armstrong's second and last spaceflight was as commander of Apollo 11, the first manned Moon landing mission in July 1969. Armstrong and Lunar Module pilot Buzz Aldrin descended to the lunar surface and spent two and a half hours outside the spacecraft, while Michael Collins remained in lunar orbit in the Command/Service Module. Along with Collins and Aldrin, Armstrong was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Richard Nixon. President Jimmy Carter presented Armstrong the Congressional Space Medal of Honor in 1978. Armstrong and his former crewmates received the Congressional Gold Medal in 2009.</p></div>
