    <h1>The Freedom of The Moon</h1>
<h2>by Robert Frost</h2>
        <div class="txt">
<p>
I've tried the new moon tilted in the air<br/>
Above a hazy tree-and-farmhouse cluster<br/>
As you might try a jewel in your hair.<br/>
I've tried it fine with little breadth of luster,<br/>
Alone, or in one ornament combining<br/>
With one first-water start almost shining.<br/>
</p>
<p>
I put it shining anywhere I please.<br/>
By walking slowly on some evening later,<br/>
I've pulled it from a crate of crooked trees,<br/>
And brought it over glossy water, greater,<br/>
And dropped it in, and seen the image wallow,<br/>
The color run, all sorts of wonder follow. 
</p>
