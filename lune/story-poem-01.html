    <h1>The Moon</h1>
<h2>by Robert Louis Stevenson (1850 - 1894)</h2>
        <div class="txt">
<p>
The moon has a face like the clock in the hall;<br/>
She shines on thieves on the garden wall,<br/>
On streets and fields and harbour quays,<br/>
And birdies asleep in the forks of the trees.
</p>
<p>
The squalling cat and the squeaking mouse,<br/>
The howling dog by the door of the house,<br/>
The bat that lies in bed at noon,<br/>
All love to be out by the light of the moon.
<p>
</p>
But all of the things that belong to the day<br/>
Cuddle to sleep to be out of her way;<br/>
And flowers and children close their eyes<br/>
Till up in the morning the sun shall arise.
</p>
